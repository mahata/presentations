Productivity tips for Ansible

# _

Ansible is super handy

# _

...but it takes long time to finish provisioning

# _

I don't like wasting time waiting for Ansible!

# Let's recall "`terminal-notifier`"

## terminal-notifier

```
$ brew install terminal-notifier
$ terminal-notifier -message "Hello, world!"
```

# _

Is it possible to integrate "terminal-notifier" to Ansible Playbooks?

# Yes, it is!

## How can we use local command in a playbook?

* Let's try [local_action](http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_delegation.html)!

```
    - name: Done - provisioning
      local_action: shell /usr/local/bin/terminal-notifier -message "All good! :)"
```

# _

Nice... but what if I miss the notification?

* Let's try [osx_say](http://docs.ansible.com/osx_say_module.html)!

```
    - name: ""
      local_action: osx_say msg="That was easy"
```

# _

Is that all that we can use for notification?

# _

[No, of course not!](http://docs.ansible.com/list_of_notification_modules.html)

* hipchat
* irc
* mail
* slack
* twilio
